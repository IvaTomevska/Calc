myCalc

This program takes a file of mathematical expressions in the form
variable = expression;
separated by new line.
And creates a file of solutions in the same order.

User first compiles the program by accessing the folder through terminal and typing "make".
This creates executable called "myCalc".

To invocate the program write:
./myspeller <file_name> <output_file_name>

We would like to give credit to Khalid Mengal for providing us with the original MAKEFILE which as well as soltion for lab5 which we have modified for this project.
